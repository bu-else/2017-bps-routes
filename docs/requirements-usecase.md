# Non-functional requirements and Use-cases for BPS-BUS

### Non-functional requirements (brainstorm):
* Logging
  * Traffic to the website
  * Performance on the client side
  * User actions (registration, login, submission)
* Storage
  * Solutions might be somewhat large (could be compressed client-side)
  * Temporary storage for submissions still under evaluation (and may only choose to keep valid solutions or the best ones)
  * Store *n* solutions
* Configuration
  * Could this be reused for other cities or for other contests
  * How many solution you would like to store?
  * Dataset for other school district -> For flexibility to adapt to other places.
* Performance
  * Evaluation on the client side
  * Transferring data (compress the data before transfer?)
  * Browser compatibility issues (No IE, No Safari)
  * Retrieving solutions
  * Visualizing the solution
* Cost
  * Storage and bandwidth
* Interoperability: does it need to work with other services or frameworks
  * Mapping API
  * Third-party storage service
  * What environment will this operate in?
  * Let user login with their Google or Github account. (OAuth) -> We will get their email for their contact. 
* Flexibility
  * Could this be reused for other application domains or scenarios
* Accessibility
  * Public website, so maybe it should follow some guidelines or conform to some standards
* Security
  * DDOS?
  * Verify that users are humans
  * Registration to upload
  * Limit submission rate
  * Should solutions be encrypted?
* Disaster recovery
  * Backup the data and user accounts
